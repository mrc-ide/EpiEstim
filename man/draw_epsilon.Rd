\title{Draw epsilon from marginal posterior distribution}
\usage{
draw_epsilon(
  R,
  incid,
  lambda,
  priors,
  shape_epsilon = NULL,
  t_min = 2L,
  t_max = nrow(incid),
  seed = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{R}{a matrix with dimensions containing values of the instantaneous
reproduction number for each time step (row) and location (column), for
the reference pathogen/strain/variant}

\item{incid}{a multidimensional array containing values of the (local)
incidence
for each time step (1st dimension), location (2nd dimension) and
pathogen/strain/variant (3rd dimension)}

\item{lambda}{a multidimensional array containing values of the overall
infectivity for each time step (1st dimension), location (2nd dimension)
and pathogen/strain/variant (3rd dimension). The overall infectivity for
a given location and pathogen/strain/variant represents the sum of
the incidence for that location and that pathogen/strain/variant at all
previous time steps, weighted by the current infectivity of those
past incident cases. It can be calculated from the incidence `incid` and
the distribution of the serial interval using function `compute_lambda`)}

\item{priors}{a list of prior parameters (shape and scale of a gamma
distribution) for epsilon and R; can be obtained from the function
`default_priors`. The prior for R is assumed to be the same for all
time steps and all locations}

\item{shape_epsilon}{a value or vector of values of the shape of the posterior
distribution of epsilon for each of the non reference variants, as returned
by function `get_shape_epsilon`}

\item{t_min}{an integer >1 giving the minimum time step to consider in the
estimation. Default value is 2 (as the estimation is conditional on
observations at time step 1 and can therefore only start at time step 2).}

\item{t_max}{an integer >`t_min` and <=`nrow(incid)` giving the maximum time
step to consider in the estimation. Default value is `nrow(incid)`.}

\item{seed}{a numeric value used to fix the random seed}
}
\value{
a value or vector of values for epsilon for each non reference
  pathogen/strain/variant, drawn from the marginal posterior distribution
}

\examples{

n_loc <- 4 # 4 locations
n_v <- 3 # 3 strains
T <- 100 # 100 time steps
priors <- default_priors()
# constant incidence 10 per day everywhere
incid <- array(10, dim = c(T, n_loc, n_v))
incid <- process_I_multivariant(incid)
# arbitrary serial interval, same for both variants
w_v <- c(0, 0.2, 0.5, 0.3)
si_distr <- cbind(w_v, w_v, w_v)
lambda <- compute_lambda(incid, si_distr)
# Constant reproduction number of 1
R <- matrix(1, nrow = T, ncol = n_loc)
R[1, ] <- NA # no estimates of R on first time step
