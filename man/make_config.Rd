\details{
Analytical estimates of the reproduction number for an epidemic over
predefined time windows can be obtained using function \code{estimate_R},  
for a given discrete distribution of the serial interval. \code{make_config}
allows to generate a configuration specifying the way the estimation will
be performed. 

The more incident cases are observed over a time window, the smallest the
posterior coefficient of variation (CV, ratio of standard deviation over
mean) of the reproduction number.
An aimed CV can be specified in the argument \code{cv_posterior} 
(default is \code{0.3}), and a warning will be produced if the incidence 
within one of the time windows considered is too low to get this CV.

The methods vary in the way the serial interval distribution is specified.

In short there are five methods to specify the serial interval distribution
(see below for details on each method).
In the first two methods, a unique serial interval distribution is
considered, whereas in the last three, a range of serial interval
distributions are integrated over:
\itemize{
\item{In method "non_parametric_si" the user specifies the discrete
distribution of the serial interval}
\item{In method "parametric_si" the user specifies the mean and sd of the
serial interval}
\item{In method "uncertain_si" the mean and sd of the serial interval are
each drawn from truncated normal distributions, with parameters specified by
the user}
\item{In method "si_from_data", the serial interval distribution is directly
estimated, using MCMC, from interval censored exposure data, with data
provided by the user together with a choice of parametric distribution for
the serial interval}
\item{In method "si_from_sample", the user directly provides the sample of
serial interval distribution to use for estimation of R. This can be a useful
 alternative to the previous method, where the MCMC estimation of the serial
 interval distribution could be run once, and the same estimated SI
 distribution then used in estimate_R in different contexts, e.g. with
 different time windows, hence avoiding to rerun the MCMC everytime
 estimate_R is called.}
}

----------------------- \code{method "non_parametric_si"} -------------------

The discrete distribution of the serial interval is directly specified in the
 argument \code{si_distr}.

----------------------- \code{method "parametric_si"} -----------------------

The mean and standard deviation of the continuous distribution of the serial
interval are given in the arguments \code{mean_si} and \code{std_si}.
The discrete distribution of the serial interval is derived automatically
using \code{\link{discr_si}}.

----------------------- \code{method "uncertain_si"} -----------------------

\code{Method "uncertain_si"} allows accounting for uncertainty on the serial
interval distribution as described in Cori et al. AJE 2013.
We allow the mean \eqn{\mu} and standard deviation \eqn{\sigma} of the serial
 interval to vary according to truncated normal distributions.
We sample \code{n1} pairs of mean and standard deviations,
\eqn{(\mu^{(1)},\sigma^{(1)}),...,(\mu^{(n_2)},\sigma^{(n_2)})}, by first
sampling the mean \eqn{\mu^{(k)}}
from its truncated normal distribution (with mean \code{mean_si}, standard
deviation \code{std_mean_si}, minimum \code{min_mean_si} and maximum
\code{max_mean_si}),
and then sampling the standard deviation \eqn{\sigma^{(k)}} from its
truncated normal distribution
(with mean \code{std_si}, standard deviation \code{std_std_si}, minimum
\code{min_std_si} and maximum \code{max_std_si}), but imposing that
\eqn{\sigma^{(k)}<\mu^{(k)}}.
This constraint ensures that the Gamma probability density function of the
serial interval is null at \eqn{t=0}.
Warnings are produced when the truncated normal distributions are not
symmetric around the mean.
For each pair \eqn{(\mu^{(k)},\sigma^{(k)})}, we then draw a sample of size
\code{n2} in the posterior distribution of the reproduction number over each
time window, conditionnally on this serial interval distribution.
After pooling, a sample of size \eqn{\code{n1}\times\code{n2}} of the joint
posterior distribution of the reproduction number over each time window is
obtained.
The posterior mean, standard deviation, and 0.025, 0.05, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75,
0.95, 0.975 quantiles of the reproduction number for each time window are
obtained from this sample.

----------------------- \code{method "si_from_data"} -----------------------

\code{Method "si_from_data"} allows accounting for uncertainty on the serial
interval distribution.
Unlike method "uncertain_si", where we arbitrarily vary the mean and std of
the SI in truncated normal distributions,
here, the scope of serial interval distributions considered is directly
informed by data
on the (potentially censored) dates of symptoms of pairs of infector/infected
 individuals.
This data, specified in argument \code{si_data}, should be a dataframe with 5
 columns:
\itemize{
\item{EL: the lower bound of the symptom onset date of the infector (given as
 an integer)}
\item{ER: the upper bound of the symptom onset date of the infector (given as
 an integer). Should be such that ER>=EL}
\item{SL: the lower bound of the symptom onset date of the infected
indivdiual (given as an integer)}
\item{SR: the upper bound of the symptom onset date of the infected
indivdiual (given as an integer). Should be such that SR>=SL}
\item{type (optional): can have entries 0, 1, or 2, corresponding to doubly
interval-censored, single interval-censored or exact observations,
respectively, see Reich et al. Statist. Med. 2009. If not specified, this
will be automatically computed from the dates}
}
Assuming a given parametric distribution for the serial interval distribution
 (specified in si_parametric_distr),
the posterior distribution of the serial interval is estimated directly fom
these data using MCMC methods implemented in the package
\code{coarsedatatools}.
The argument \code{mcmc_control} is a list of characteristics which control
the MCMC.
The MCMC is run for a total number of iterations of
\code{mcmc_control$burnin + n1*mcmc_control$thin};
but the output is only recorded after the burnin, and only 1 in every
\code{mcmc_control$thin} iterations,
so that the posterior sample size is \code{n1}.
For each element in the posterior sample of serial interval distribution,
we then draw a sample of size \code{n2} in the posterior distribution of the
reproduction number over each time window,
conditionnally on this serial interval distribution.
After pooling, a sample of size \eqn{\code{n1}\times\code{n2}} of the joint
posterior distribution of
the reproduction number over each time window is obtained.
The posterior mean, standard deviation, and 0.025, 0.05, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75,
0.95, 0.975 quantiles of the reproduction number for each time window are
obtained from this sample.

----------------------- \code{method "si_from_sample"} ----------------------

\code{Method "si_from_sample"} also allows accounting for uncertainty on the
serial interval distribution.
Unlike methods "uncertain_si" and "si_from_data", the user directly provides
(in argument \code{si_sample}) a sample of serial interval distribution to be
 explored.
