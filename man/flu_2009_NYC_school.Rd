\title{Data on the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic in a school in New York city}
\format{A list of two elements:
\itemize{
\item \strong{incidence}: a dataframe with 14 lines containing dates in first column,
and daily incidence in second column ,
\item \strong{si_data}: a dataframe containing data on the generation time for 16
pairs of infector/infected individuals (see references and see argument
\code{si_data} of function \code{\link[=estimate_R]{estimate_R()}} for details on columns)

\description{
This data set gives:
\enumerate{
\item the daily incidence of self-reported and laboratory-confirmed cases of
influenza amongst children in a school in New York city during the 2009
H1N1 influenza pandemic (see source and references),
\item interval-censored serial interval data from the 2009 outbreak of H1N1
influenza in a New York city school (see references).
}

## Note the following examples use an MCMC routine
## to estimate the serial interval distribution from data,
## so they may take a few minutes to run

## load data on pandemic flu in a New York school in 2009

## estimate the reproduction number (method "si_from_data")
